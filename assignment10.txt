Answer1. The default value of an array depends on the data type of the elements in the array. Here are some common default values for different data types:

         1.Integer types (int, long, short, etc.): The default value is typically 0.
         2.Floating-point types (float, double): The default value is usually 0.0.
         3.Boolean type (bool): The default value is often false (0).
         4.Character types (char): The default value is usually the null character, which is represented as '\0'.
         5.Object types (classes, structures, etc.): The default value is generally null.

Answer2. No, it is not possible to pass a negative number as the size of an array. Array sizes must be non-negative integers. The size of an array determines the number of elements it can         
         hold, and a negative size does not make sense.

Answer3. In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), arrays are stored in the heap memory.

Answer4. Arrays have several disadvantages that you should consider when using them:
         
         1.Fixed Size
         2.Continuous Memory Allocation
         3.Not Suitable for Heterogeneous Data

Answer5. In Java, an anonymous array is an array that is declared and instantiated without assigning it to a named variable. It is created on the fly and used directly in an expression or as 
         an argument to a method.
         example:-
                  
     public class Anonymous {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numbers[] = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        int sum = calculateSum(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);

        printNames(new String[]{"harsh", "ram", "shyam"});
    }

    public static int calculateSum(int[] array) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : array) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void printNames(String[] array) {
        for (String name : array) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }
}


Answer6. In Java, there are several ways to traverse an array, depending on the specific requirements of your code. Here are some common approaches:

         1.Using a for loop
         2.Using an enhanced for loop (for-each loop)
         
Answer7. 1.length :- It is a property of arrays in Java, denoted without parentheses. The length property gives the number of elements in the array. It is used to access the size of 
           an array and is a final variable that cannot be modified.

         example:-
               int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
               int size = numbers.length;
               System.out.println("Array size: " + size);

        2.length() method: It is a method of the String class in Java, denoted with parentheses. The length() method is used to determine the number of characters in a string. It returns 
          an integer representing the length of the string. 
 
         example:-
            String message = "Hello, world!";
            int length = message.length();
            System.out.println("String length: " + length);
