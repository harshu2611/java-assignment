Answer1. Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is widely used in software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project by keeping track of changes                                        
         to files over time.

Answer2. A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that helps manage changes to files and track different versions of those files over time.
         1. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)
         2. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

Answer3. GitHub is a web-based hosting service and a platform for version control using Git. It provides a graphical user interface and a variety of collaboration features to make it easier 
         for individuals and teams to work on software development projects. GitHub is widely used by developers and organizations around the world to host, manage, and collaborate on code
         repositories.

Answer4. 1. GitLab
         2. Bitbucket
         3. SourceForge

Answer5. 1. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): CVCSs have a central server that stores the repository of files and their versions. Developers check out files from the central server      
            to work on them locally and then commit their changes back to the server.
        
         2. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): DVCSs provide each developer with a complete copy of the repository, including its entire history. This allows developers to work 
            independently, commit changes locally, and later synchronize those changes with other repositories.  

Answer6. 1. version history
         2. distributed development
         3. speed and performance 
         4. collaboration and code review
         5. community and open source ecosystem

Answer7. A Git repository is a storage location where all the files, directories, and the complete version history of a project are stored. It is the core component of Git and serves as a 
         central hub for managing and tracking changes to files over time.

Answer8. By using git init command.
