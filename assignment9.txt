Answer1. An array is a structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. It is a collection of elements arranged in a contiguous block of memory, where each
         element can be accessed using an index or a key.

Answer2. We create an array in java using following syntax:-
             
          dataType arrayName[] = new dataType[arraySize];

Answer3. In Java, the size of an array is fixed once it is created, and it cannot be changed at runtime.

Answer4. In Java, you cannot declare an array without assigning the size of the array. 

Answer5. The default values of array elements depend on the data type of the array. 
     
         1.For numeric types (byte, short, int, long, float, double): The default value is 0.
         2.For the boolean type (boolean): The default value is false.
         3.For the char type (char): The default value is the null character, '\u0000'.
         4.For reference types (Object types, arrays, and classes): The default value is null.

Answer6. A 1D array, also known as a one-dimensional array, is a linear collection of elements of the same data type. 
         example:- int numbers[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
         
Answer7. public class TwoArray{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		int a[][]= {
					{1,5,4},
					{8,4,2},
					{3,7,9},
                                        {5,7,3}
				};
		
		for(int i=0;i<=3;i++)
		{
			for(int j=0;j<=2;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(a[i][j]+ " ");
			}
			System.out.println();
		} 
	}
}
