Answer1. A programming language is a language designed to communicate instructions to a computer or machine. It provides a set of rules and syntax that allows programmers to write
         code to solve specific problems or perform desired tasks. Programming languages serve as a medium for humans to interact with computers.

Answer2. we ned programming language becuase of the following reasons:-
         1.Communication with computers.
         2.Software development.
         3.problem solving.
         4.efficiency and productivity.
         5.scalibility and flexibility.

Answer3. here are some features of java.
         1.platform independence
         2.object oriented programming (OOP)
         3.security
         4.multithreading support
         5.exceptional handling

Answer4. An object is a particular instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that encapsulates data (also known as attributes or properties) and the 
         behaviors (methods) that operate on that data. Objects are the building blocks of object-oriented programming in Java.

Answer5. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure, behavior, and state of objects. It serves as a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming (OOP).

Answer6. The main() method is a special method that serves as the entry point for a Java program. It acts as the starting point of execution when you run a Java application.
         Inside the main() method, you write the code that should be executed when the program starts running. This code can include variable declarations, control flow statements (if-else,
         loops), method invocations, and other Java statements.
         It's important to note that every Java application must have a main() method as the entry point. Without the main() method, the program cannot be executed directly.
