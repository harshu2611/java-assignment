Answer1. To create an object in Java, you need to follow these steps:
         1.Define a Class.
         2.Instantiate an Object by using New keyword.
         3.Access Object.

Answer2. In Java, the new keyword is used to create an instance of a class called object
         it also allocate memory for an object. 

Answer3. There are mainly three types of variables in java:-
         1. local variables
         2. instance variables
         3. static variables

Answer4. 1. INSTANCE VARIABLE:- Instance variables are declared within a class but outside of any method, constructor, or block. They are also known as non-static variables because they                
                                belong to individual instances (objects) of a class. Each object has its own copy of instance variables.                                                                                                
        
         2. LOCAL VARIABLES:- Local variables are declared within a method, constructor, or a block of code. They are only accessible within the scope where they are declared. Local    
                              variables must be initialized before they are used.

Answer5. Memory for instance variables is allocated on the heap.
         Memory for local variables is allocated on the stack. 

Answer6. Method overloading in Java refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class. It allows a class to have multiple 
         methods with the same name but different behaviors based on the types and/or number of arguments passed to them.

         The compiler determines which overloaded method to call based on the number, types, and order of the arguments provided when the method is invoked.

         The following are the rules for method overloading:

         1.Methods must have the same name.
         2.Methods must be defined within the same class.
         3.Methods must have different parameter lists.
